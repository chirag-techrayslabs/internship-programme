## ReactJs Training Program
Welcome to the React.js section of our Intern Training Program! This program will guide you through the basics of React.js, modern JavaScript (ES6+), and essential tools such as React Router and Redux for state management. You will learn through hands-on exercises, tutorials, and projects to give you a solid foundation in building React applications.

### Getting Started
1. Setup Node.js Development Environment https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-22-04
2. Install React.js using Create React App :
npx create-react-app my-app

Resources
To start learning ReactJs, we recommend watching the following comprehensive video course:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vz1RlUyrc3w&list=PLu71SKxNbfoDqgPchmvIsL4hTnJIrtige&ab_channel=ChaiaurCode
 
Projects After completing the video course, you will work on two practical projects to apply what you've learned.

### Project1: Todo App

### Basic Features:
This project is a basic Todo application that allows users to add, remove, and update tasks.

1. Add New Todo
 - Users can enter a new task in a text input and add it to the list.

2. Mark Todo as Completed:
 - Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking a checkbox next to each task.
 
3. Delete Todo:
 - Users can remove a task from the list by clicking a delete button next to the task.

4. Edit Todo:
- Allow users to edit a task after adding it.

Use local storage or session storage to store data to save tasks so that they persist after page refreshes.

### Project1: Movie Search App with React and API Integration

### Basic Features:
This project will allow users to search for movies using the OMDB API.

1. Search Movies:
- Users can type a movie name in the search box and see matching results from the OMDB API.

2. Display Movie Details:
- Display detailed information about each movie, such as title, release year, genre, and poster.
 
3. Handle Errors:
- Display an error message if no movies are found or if there’s an issue with the API request.


### React Router :

React Router allows for navigation and routing in React applications, making it easy to build multi-page apps.

### State Management with Redux :

Redux is a state management tool that helps manage the application’s state in a predictable way, especially for larger apps.

Redux Documentation : https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started

### Context API (as an alternative to Redux):

A built-in alternative to Redux for managing state globally within a React application.
